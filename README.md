# Toronto JS Proposals (RFCs)

This repository maintain a list of all the proposals for improving the Toronto JS (TJS) community. This is a place to discuss and collaborate on the future of the Toronto JS community.

## What is a proposal?

A proposal follows the model of an RFC (Request for Comments). It is a document that describes a new feature or change to some part of the TJS community. It should provide a concise and clear explanation of the proposed change, and should include the motivation for the change and the benefits of the change.

## How to submit a proposal? What is the process?

1. Create an [issue in this repository](https://github.com/torontojs/proposals/issues/new?assignees=&labels=proposal%2Cneeds+triage&projects=&template=proposal.yml&title=%5BPROPOSAL%5D+-+) with the title of your proposal, prefixed with `[PROPOSAL] - `. This issue will automatically load the [issue template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/proposal.yml) for proposals. You just need to fill in the details.
2. Tag the organizers using the `@torontojs/organizers` handle.
3. Once the proposal is submitted, the organizers will review and give feedback on the proposal.
4. One of the organizers will be assigned as the champion for the proposal. The champion will be responsible for helping with the bureaucratic process and to move to the next steps. They are also responsible to keep the proposal updated and to answer any questions that may arise.
5. If needed, create a repository with the proposal and link it to the issue.
6. The proposal will be approved or rejected by the organizers. If approved, the champion will be responsible for following up on the proposal implementation.
